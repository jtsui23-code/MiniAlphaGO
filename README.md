# Mini AlphaGo (9x9) - Work In Progress
A full-stack web application with user authentication that allows players to compete against Go AI bots of varying difficulty levels. Each AI is built from the ground up using a custom Go engine, reinforcement learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and a self-trained neural policy/value network.

## Features
### âœ… Implemented

-  **Go Engine** â€“ Clean Python implementation of 9x9 Go rules.
-  **Policy & Value Network** â€“ PyTorch neural network for move prediction and win estimation.
-  **MCTS Integration** â€“ Search algorithm guided by neural policy and value.
-  **Self-Play Training** â€“ Replay buffer + reinforcement learning loop.

###  Work In Progress
-  **Interactive Web App** â€“ Play against the AI in real-time via React + WebSocket frontend.
-  **Login & Game Logs** â€“ View previous games after logging in.
-  **Dockerized Deployment** â€“ Reproducible containerized setup.
